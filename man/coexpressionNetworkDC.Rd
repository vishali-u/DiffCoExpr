\title{Another example coexpression network that was generated using the same PBMC
data. To generate the data, we ran prepareData using the example
data in the package, getExpressionMatrix with the cell type
set to "DC", getCorrelationMatrix with the expression, and finally
getCoexpressionNetwork with the correlation matrix. This object was included
to make the examples in the function descriptions run faster.}

A dataframe with 47895 observations and 3 variables
