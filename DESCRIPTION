Description: DiffCoExpr is an R package that will compare co-expression networks constructed from scRNA-seq data. It can be used to compare co-expression networks under two different conditions and compare co-expression networks between cell-types to determine if co-expression is cell-type specific. Additionally, DiffCoExpr offers the ability to construct co-variance matrices as well to determine if gene expression changes are correlated.
